-- both have 5 values: Complete, Processing, Shipped, Cancelled, Returned
-- nulls in shipped_at, delivered_at, returned_at are expected — not a data issue

-- checking all city values to confirm null distribution
-- Shanghai, Beijing, Seoul are top cities showing healthy city data for most countries
-- city = 'null' (stored as text) affects multiple countries

-- checking countries affected by null values
-- Brasil has the most, followed by US, South Korea, Spain
-- less than 1% of total users affected — not critical for analysis
-- not critical for analysis, we will use country level for geographic insights
